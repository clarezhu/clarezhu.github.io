  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <div>
    (Former) Student and research assistant at Stanford. In 2019, I transitioned from a five year career in alpha helices to a five year career in alpha research.
  <p>
      I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science as well as a Master's degree in Computer Science which I completed coterminally at Stanford.
      During that time, I also completed a minor in Mathematics. My coursework consisted of primarily machine learning, followed by theory and algorithms.
  <p>
      Once in a blue moon, I post to my <a href="https://nothingtodeclareblog.blogspot.com/">personal blog.</a> (Note: this blog does not represent the views of [current-employer] or any [past-employers], or [alma-mater].)

  <h3>Stanford-related</h3>
  <div>I am often asked, "which classes should I take at Stanford"/"how to make the most of my time at Stanford" by aspiring undergraduates, and generally speaking this is what I answer.</div>
  <div>
      <ul>
          <li>Cornerstones. Figure out the top five classes which interest you, and solve the dependency graph so that you get to take them all before you graduate. Here were mine:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>CS 155, EE 364A/B, MATH 145, CS 231N, CS 261.</li>
              <li>A good pick for your top five: CS 364A, algorithmic game theory, formerly taught by Tim Roughgarden at Stanford. His course notes can still be found on <a href="https://timroughgarden.org/f13/f13.html">his personal site</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Other classes which I think are a worthwhile addition to any undergraduate curriculum regardless of major.</li>
          <ul>
              <li>ARTHIST 1B with Alex Nemerov.</li>
              <li>Social I with Richard Powers.</li>
              <li>English 167H, The Ethical Gangster, with Blakey Vermeule.</li>
              <li>GERLANG 20K, Kuche Mitte.</li>
              <li>If you have any interest in Russia or Russian history at all, take a class with Prof. Nancy Kollmann, who was my Resident Fellow and who teaches HIST 20N, Russia in the Modern European Imagination.</li>
              <li>Take EMED 110, Basic Life Support, tell all your friends to take it, save a life.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Classes I wish I'd taken.</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Decision Making Under Uncertainty (CS 238).</li>
              <li>Beginning Improv (TAPS 103).</li>
              <li>Intro Optimization (MS&E 111).</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Things to do at Stanford before you graduate (non-academic). This is the most personal and hardest question to answer.</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Go to a dance. Jammix, FNW, Dancebreak, and Viennese Ball to name a few.</li>
              <li>Get a zipcar and take all your friends to Safeway at 3 AM for a late night snack run. (Legends are born at the Secret Safeway, but I won't tell you which one that is.)</li>
              <li>Just do the dumbest stuff imaginable. In eight years (where I'm at now), you won't remember grinding psets and final exams, but you will remember being a bunch of incorrigible idiots with your freshman year dormmates. Video evidence optional.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
