  <h2>Vita</h2>
    I was born in Iowa and hail originally from Shrewsbury, MA. 
  <p>
      I hold a Bachelor's as well as a Master's degree in Computer Science which I completed coterminally at Stanford.
      During that time, I also completed a minor in Mathematics. My coursework consisted of primarily machine learning, followed by theory and algorithms.
  <p>
      In the past ten years, I've counted these cities among my homes: Irvine (Ca.), San Diego, Baltimore, Beijing, Palo Alto, Fairfield (Conn.), Chicago, Boston, New York City, and Miami.

          <li>“I have very special parents,” she said. “They never forced me to do things. Do what makes you happy, they told me. And I’ve found research makes me happy.” She added, “They showed me great love by trusting me to be on my own.”</span></li>

  <h3>Stanford-related things to do</h3>
  <div>
      <ul>
          <li>Go to a dance. Jammix, FNW, Dancebreak, and Viennese Ball to name a few.</li>
          <li>Rush a sorority or a frat, even if you aren't sure about pledging.</li>
          <li>Get a zipcar and take all your friends to Safeway at 3 AM for a late night snack run. (Legends are born at the Secret Safeway, but I won't tell you which one that is.)</li>
          <li>Ask the folks at Late Nite to make you a milkshake with "everything." They should know what that means.</li>
          <li>Alternatives to fountain hopping: Climb the McMurtry rooftop, eat an Ike's sandwich, go to Maus after dark, bring a floatie to Lake Lag (whether or not there's water), climb the gutters behind MemChu, invite yourself on a tour of the sewers.</li>
          <li>I am told that they renovated and fortified the Main Quad crawlspace but I'm sure that alone won't stop Stanford's best.</li>
      </ul>
