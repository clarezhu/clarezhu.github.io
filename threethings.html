  <h1>Why?</h1>
  <p>
      One of my favorite things I learned in school was <a href="https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/threethings.html">Prof. Vakil's "Three Things"</a> exercise for getting things out of talks:
     <i>The theory is as follows. If you can get even three small things out of a talk, it is a successful talk. And if you can't get even three small things out of a talk, it was not a successful experience.</i>
     <p>
      (In this page, "talk" is interchanged rather generously with "stuff I liked or found memorable".)
