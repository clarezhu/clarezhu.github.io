Hello,
<p>
If you are reading this, it is because you at one point expressed an interest in the wellbeing of my avocado pufferfish, Leo. 
Perhaps you fed him, helped me move his tank, checked on him while I was on vacation, or simply asked to see him in person.
<p>
Yesterday, as of 9:45 PM, Leo no longer swims on this earth with us. He was about three to four years old, in his middle age, and had grown to almost three inches tip to tail.
<p>
This goofball had a penchant for dancing to music, watching (and snacking on) snails, and was on occasion found with an entire cherry shrimp head sticking out of his mouth. 
He had a curiosity for the outside world, as well. Guests often had him swimming to the front for a better look, or sent him to the back in hiding, depending on his sociability level that day.
In all my days in Miami, I could not have hoped for a better companion to grace my mornings and evenings, to confide in after a long day, to simply be with in silence.
I thank you for the two precious years I shared with my gentlest of lions.
<p>
Gone from yourself, but not gone from our hearts.
